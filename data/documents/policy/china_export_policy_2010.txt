China Export Restrictions on Critical Minerals (2010)

In 2010, China implemented significant export quotas on rare earth elements 
and other critical minerals, including graphite. Key policy measures included:

- Export quotas reduced by 30-40% compared to 2009 levels
- Licensing requirements tightened for mineral exports
- Environmental compliance standards raised for mining operations

These restrictions were justified on environmental protection grounds but had 
significant impacts on global supply chains. Major importing countries including 
the United States, Japan, and EU members faced supply disruptions.

Market response included:
- Price increases of 300-500% for certain rare earth elements
- Acceleration of alternative supplier development (Australia, U.S., Canada)
- Increased recycling and substitution efforts
- Strategic stockpile discussions in importing nations

The 2010 restrictions highlighted vulnerabilities in concentrated supply chains 
and prompted policy reviews regarding critical mineral dependencies.
