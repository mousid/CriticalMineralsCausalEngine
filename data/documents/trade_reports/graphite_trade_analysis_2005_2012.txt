Graphite Trade Patterns 2005-2012

This analysis examines U.S. graphite import trends during a period of significant 
market evolution. Key findings:

Baseline Period (2005-2007):
- Average annual imports: $34 million USD
- Primary suppliers: China (72%), Mexico (12%), Canada (8%)
- Stable pricing with low volatility

Disruption Period (2008-2010):
- 2008: Sharp increase to $53M (46% above baseline) due to industrial demand
- 2009: Decline to $32M following financial crisis demand destruction
- 2010: Recovery to $57M amid China export policy changes

Post-Shock Period (2011-2012):
- Sustained higher trade values ($87M in 2011)
- Supply chain diversification efforts
- Emergence of synthetic graphite alternatives

The data suggests that graphite markets exhibit significant responsiveness to 
both demand shocks (financial crisis) and supply shocks (export restrictions), 
with adjustment periods of 2-3 years for new supply capacity.
