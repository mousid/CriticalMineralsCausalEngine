Graphite Market Summary 2008

Natural graphite imports to the United States increased significantly in 2008, 
reaching approximately 53 million USD, up from a baseline of 32-37 million USD 
in prior years. This increase was driven by several factors:

1. Strong industrial demand from steel and automotive sectors
2. Limited domestic production capacity
3. Growing dependence on imports from China and other suppliers

China remained the dominant supplier, accounting for over 70% of U.S. natural 
graphite imports. Alternative suppliers included Mexico, Canada, and Madagascar.

Price volatility was observed in Q3 2008, with spot prices increasing 25-40% 
above 2007 levels due to supply chain constraints and export quota discussions 
in China.

The financial crisis in late 2008 led to demand destruction in Q4, with some 
recovery expected in subsequent years pending economic stabilization.
